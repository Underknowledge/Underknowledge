## 👋 Hi there, I'm Underknowledge

### ✨ Fun Fact:
Most of my work happens behind closed repositories, ensuring production systems run smoothly 24/7.     
You won’t find much here publicly—my code is busy working hard where it matters!    
    
    
### 👷‍♂️ What I Do:
    
- **DevOps:** handling infrastructure using **Pulumi** and **Ansible**, **GitLab-CI** for the intigation, 
- **System Administration:** Deep **Linux** expertise, configuring and maintaining hundreds of systems in both cloud and on-prem environments.
- **Nix/NixOS Advocate:** Passionate about Nix and the reproducible environments you get. (terrible name by the way)
